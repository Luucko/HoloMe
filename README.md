### Project Overview  
This project was part of the third-semester **Analysis and Development Project** course. The assignment challenged us to design a futuristic, **human-centered digital solution** for the fictional world of **Adria 2084**—a society shaped by advanced technologies and complex societal issues.

Our team conceptualized **HoloMe**: a **holographic communication and presence system** designed to combat **loneliness and social fragmentation** in a hyper-digitalized society. The goal was to enable rich, meaningful remote interactions by projecting realistic holographic representations of people into homes, workspaces, or public areas.

### Key Deliverables I Contributed To

- **Business Case Development**  
  Included a compelling problem-solution narrative, stakeholder mapping, user impact analysis, and feasibility reasoning based on the Adria 2084 context.

- **MoSCoW Prioritization**  
  Classified functional and non-functional requirements, emphasizing what was essential for a believable MVP in the Adria universe.

- **User Story Mapping & Personas**  
  Captured varied user needs, from **isolated elderly citizens** to **corporate professionals** seeking richer remote collaboration.

### System Blueprinting  

- **BPMN Diagrams**  
  Modeled key service flows like **booking holographic sessions** and **user onboarding**.

- **C4 Diagrams**  
  Illustrated architectural layers from user-facing interfaces to **holographic rendering services**.

- **UML Class & Sequence Diagrams**  
  Mapped out **system interactions** and **data structures**.

### Additional Contributions & Learning Points  

- **UI Mockups in Figma**  
  Designed interfaces for wearables and mobile devices, with a strong focus on **accessibility** and **emotion-aware UI**.

- **Risk Analysis & Ethical Considerations**  
  Explored themes like **digital fatigue**, **surveillance concerns**, and **data ownership**.

- **Validation Plan**  
  Outlined how to test an MVP in the future using **user feedback loops** and **integration strategies** with Adria's digital infrastructure.

### Reflection  
While our concept was praised for its **vision and storytelling**, we received feedback to better align **technical feasibility** with our ambitious ideas—especially regarding **backend complexity** and deployment logistics.

This project was a deep dive into **systemic design thinking**, **cross-disciplinary teamwork**, and **balancing innovation with realism**. It pushed me to think about what **digital products can truly mean to people**—beyond just solving a problem.
